## How it Works

1. The app prompts the user to enter their name.
2. Based on the first letter of the name, it changes the background color and positions a ball on a thermometer-like visual.
3. The user selects their mood by clicking one of the buttons.
4. The app simulates a "thinking" process and then displays:
   - A food combination suggestion.
   - A fun message based on the selected mood.
5. Users can click "Try Again" to get a new combination.
